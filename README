litebrite

## ABOUT

litebrite is a library for generating syntax-highlighted HTML from your Go
source code.  See dhconnelly.github.com/litebrite for more details.

## INSTALL

go get github.com/dhconnelly/litebrite
go install github.com/dhconnelly/litebrite

## USAGE

   import "github.com/dhconnelly/litebrite"

   ...

   h := new(litebrite.Highlighter)
   h.CommentClass = "commentz"
   h.OperatorClass = "opz"
   html := h.Highlight(myCodez)

This will return a string of HTML where every comment in the string myCodez
is wrapped with a <div class="commentz"> tag and every operator is wrapped
with a <div class="opz"> tag.

The following string fields are available on a Highlighter struct.  Setting
a field to a non-nil value causes tokens of that type to be wrapped with a
<div> that has your specified CSS class name.

CommentClass
OperatorClass
IdentClass
LiteralClass
KeywordClass
